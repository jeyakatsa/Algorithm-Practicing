About myself:
 - over 3 years of Front-End & Back-End Software Development experience
in Solidity, Java, JavaScript, AWS, and many other tools and programs

Weaknesses:  
 - Too Nice
Strengths:  
 - Persistance in solving problems

challenges: 
 - While building a light client for Consensys, 
it was difficult to bridge the IDE they were using to
the consensus layer, so in order to solve that issue, I had to use
a trial & error approach while using StackOverflow.

Mistakes/Failures: 
 - Overpromising and underdelivering on some past projects I would
say were by biggest mistakes and failures.

What I'd to differently:
 - Underpromise, and overdeliver on expectations.

Enjoyed: 
 - Building projects that solve problems for developers and users.

Leadership:
 - I managed to convince a few developers who I was in class with
to join me into building my Cryptocurrency project by building the
prototype.

Conflicts: 
 - There was a conflict with a developer whom I was leading who couldn't
solve a technical problem in time. So I had to step in and help him solve
the issue so we could complete the project within the proposed deadline.
